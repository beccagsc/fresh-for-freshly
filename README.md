# javascript-interview

There are 3 parts to this take-home assessment:

---
### Part 1
> Create a Restful API in `server.js` with the functionality to sucessfully pass the scenarios found at `cypress/integration/interview/interview-part-1.spec.js`.

I did not have time to finish the API and tests. Hopefully the 2 users endpoints that I did will serve as POC.

### Part 2
> Complete the exercise found in `interview-part-2`

Done
>
### Part 3
> Finally, complete the exercise found in `interview-part-3`

There are just a couple of TODOs in the cypress file. Also, the tests will break if the meals that are available change. I could definitely re-write it to accommodate that.
